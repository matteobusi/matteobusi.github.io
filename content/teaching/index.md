+ **Tutor for the _Turing Machine Programming National & International Contest_ (14 -- 17 Sep 2021)**

  National (Italian) and International competition where high-school students were asked to program a Turing machine to
  solve algorithmic problems.
  In collaboration with others, my duties were to translate training material from Italian, prepare the solutions to the
  proposed exercises, and adapt the existing evaluating software to the new requirements (fixing its security a bit and provide a
  page with live results).
  More details on the contest can be found [in this (archived) page](https://web.archive.org/web/20210620012956/https://www.turingcontest.com/).
